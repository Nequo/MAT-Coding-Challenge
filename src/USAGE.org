#+TITLE: MAT challenge backend application

* Usage
Make sure that you have docker-compose running properly as it is described in
the repository's [[file:~/MAT-Coding-Challenge/README.md][README file]].
I used pipenv to manage the python environment. Instructions for installing are
[[https://github.com/pypa/pipenv][here]]. Run `pipenv install` from the project's main directory. This will install
all the necessary packages from  the provided Pipfile. Now you can run `pipenv
run python src/backend.py` which will run the application.
